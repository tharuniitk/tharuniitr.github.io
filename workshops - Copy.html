            <strong>CT Lin</strong><br>
            School of Computer Science, University of Technology, Sydney<br>
            Distinguished Professor Chin-Teng Lin is a leading researcher in artificial intelligence (AI) and brain computer interfaces (BCI), developing systems of brain information processing and communication with machines. Lin studies the brain and behaviours, the physiological changes that occur when human cognitive functions are working, and ways to combine human physiological information with artificial intelligence to develop monitoring and feedback systems. He wants to improve the flow of information from humans to robots, so humans can make better decisions and respond to complex, stressful situations, and so that robots can better understand the status and intention of humans to augment human-machine cooperation. This is an emerging trend identified in the fifth Industrial Revolution to deliver a common good for humanity. Lin was the inventor of fuzzy neural networks (FNN) in 1992, introducing neural-network learning into fuzzy systems and incorporating human-like reasoning into neural networks. Since then, there have been about 500,000 articles about FNN published online. Lin has since developed a series of FNN models with various learning capabilities suitable for different learning environments, as well as targets on multi-agent reinforcement learning for multi-drone coordination and cybersecurity. Lin joined UTS in 2016 as Co-Director of the Australian AI Institute (AAII) to advance AI and BCI. He also secured an industry funding to establish the GrapheneX-UTS Human-centric AI (HAI) Centre in 2023. A highly published researcher in the fields of machine-intelligent systems and brain computer interface, Lin is also the founding director of the Computational Intelligence and Brain Computer Interface Lab at the Australian AI Institute, at UTS. The Lab is developing mobile sensing technology to measure brain activity using non-invasive methods, to assess human cognitive states. Lin led a large-scale 10-year project ($10 million) on Cognition and Neuroergonomics (2010-20) with the US Army Research Lab. The project explored advanced BCI technologies by studying the effects of vehicle motion and cognitive fatigue, and developing wearable EEG devices.
